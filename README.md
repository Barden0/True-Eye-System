# True Eye

A computer vision project with real-time object detection, classification, and segmentation AI model built with python, OpenCV and YOLOv8 by Ultralytics.

I utilised YOLOv8 Nano which is the fastest and smallest though you can opt for a different YOLO models such as YOLOv8x which is the most accurate and slowest among the other YOLOv8 models. 
All you have to do is change the suffix after 'YOLOv8' in line 8 of `True Eye.py`

Remove the comment keys from lines 8-10 before running it then continue adding codes from line 10 downwards.
